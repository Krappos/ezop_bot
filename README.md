ðŸ“– About
This repository contains the core code for Ezop, a fun and lightweight Discord bot that generates poems based on the last message sent before the !ezop command.

Ezop is intentionally simple and unpredictable, which is part of its charm and humor.

ðŸ§  Note: This bot is not intended for serious use. It's designed purely for entertainment.
